I know for me personally, I‚Äôve felt a bit overwhelmed. But it‚Äôs helped tremendously to talk to fellow classmates & others to just get it off my chest & regroup. If you need someone to talk to, or to just vent your frustrations about anything, please know I‚Äôm always willing to listen; or reach out to anyone you‚Äôre comfortable talking to. We‚Äôre really out here doing this MBA thing, but it can be both mentally & emotionally taxing. Mental heath can‚Äôt be overstated. Thanks to @Kathleen Goins for reminding me of the importance of this yesterday. That‚Äôs all I got.

We talked about the concerns about this being a public speaking class and not a business communications class and he just wants everybody to know that the first part is speech heavy as to build a foundation for the rest of the class, next week we start on written communications. As for the workload of the course, it was not ideal timing for this course to start but he has no control over when he was able to start teaching, he has a better understanding of our current course load and I made some suggestions around structuring assignments around our upcoming finals.
